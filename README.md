# KaratsubaRecursiveMultiplication

/**
 * @author Prithviraj Deshmane
 * 
 * The following is a java solution for the Karatsuba multiplication technique
 * for determining the product of two very large numbers. 
 * The program recursively breaks down the larger numbers and then 
 * combines the individual results to calculate the final value of the product.
 * This results in the runtime O(n*log(n)) as opposed to O(n^2) 
 * of the traditional long multiplication technique.
