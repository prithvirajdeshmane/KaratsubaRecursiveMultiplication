# KaratsubaRecursiveMultiplication

@author Prithviraj Deshmane

The following is a java solution for the Karatsuba multiplication technique
for determining the product of two very large numbers. 
The program recursively breaks down the larger numbers and then 
combines the individual results to calculate the final value of the product.
This results in the runtime O(n*log(n)) as opposed to O(n^2) 
of the traditional long multiplication technique.

NOTE: 
The actual java code files for this project can be found inside the "src" folder. 
This program was written using the Eclipse IDE. 
Eclipse auto-generates XML metadata and a folder structure for the project.
